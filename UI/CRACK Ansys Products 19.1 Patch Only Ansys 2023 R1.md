In this article, we will highlight some of the key benefits and capabilities of Ansys Products 19.1 that make it a must-have for any engineer who wants to stay ahead of the competition and deliver innovative products to the market.
 
## Ansys Twin Builder: The First Comprehensive Solution for Simulation-Based Digital Twins
 
One of the most exciting features of Ansys Products 19.1 is Ansys Twin Builder, a first-of-its-kind product that enables customers to build, validate and deploy simulation-based digital twins within one workflow[^2^]. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical product that combines accurate physics-based simulation with data collected from sensors using industrial internet of things (IIoT) platforms. A digital twin can provide valuable insights into the product's performance, health, and behavior in real-world operating conditions, enabling engineers to optimize maintenance schedules, reduce downtime, improve efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
