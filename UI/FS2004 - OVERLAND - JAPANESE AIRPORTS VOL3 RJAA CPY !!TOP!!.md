One of the highlights of the scenery package is Narita International Airport (RJAA), the busiest airport in Japan and one of the busiest in the world. The airport has two runways and four terminals, serving domestic and international flights. The scenery captures the airport's complex layout and architecture, with accurate terminal buildings, jetways, gates, and signs. The airport also features dynamic traffic and animations, such as moving buses, trucks, and baggage carts. The scenery also includes the nearby town of Narita and some landmarks, such as the Narita-san Shinsho-ji Temple[^1^].
 
Another airport that is worth visiting is Tokyo International Airport (RJTT), also known as Haneda Airport. This airport is located closer to the city center than Narita, and serves mainly domestic flights and some international flights. The airport has four runways and three terminals, with a fourth terminal under construction. The scenery depicts the airport's modern and futuristic design, with glass and steel structures, curved roofs, and colorful lights. The airport also has a lot of activity and traffic, with planes taking off and landing every few minutes. The scenery also includes the surrounding cityscape of Tokyo, with skyscrapers, bridges, and highways[^4^].
 
A third airport that is included in the scenery package is Oshima Airport (RJTO), a small regional airport located on Oshima Island, south of Tokyo. This airport has one runway and one terminal, serving flights to Tokyo and other nearby islands. The scenery offers a contrast to the busy and urban airports of Narita and Haneda, with a tranquil and natural setting. The airport is surrounded by green hills, forests, and fields, with a view of the ocean and the volcano Mount Mihara. The scenery also features realistic ground textures, custom buildings, static aircraft, and seasonal variations.
