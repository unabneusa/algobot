The book is based on the original Clark's Tables, which was first published in 1971 by Boyd and Oliver[^2^]. The book was named after John Clark, a Scottish mathematician and astronomer who compiled many tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions in the 18th century. The book was widely used by students and teachers of science and engineering for many years.
 
The book was revised and updated by R. M. Tennent in 2006, who added more tables and data to reflect the changes and advances in science and technology[^1^] [^3^]. The book also adopted the SI units and symbols for consistency and clarity. The book was published by Pearson Education, a leading publisher of educational books and materials.
 
The book is one of the best-selling science data books in India, with over 500,000 copies sold since its first edition[^3^]. The book has also been translated into several languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, and Urdu. The book is widely used by students preparing for various competitive exams, such as JEE, NEET, BITSAT, etc.
