# Ballet for Life: A Tribute to Queen, Mozart and Versace
 
Ballet for Life is a stunning choreography by Maurice BÃ©jart, one of the most influential ballet masters of the 20th century. It is a celebration of youth, hope and love, inspired by the music of Queen and Mozart and the costumes of Gianni Versace. It is also a homage to two icons of the performing arts, Jorge Donn and Freddie Mercury, who died of AIDS in the 1990s.
 
The ballet was created in 1996 in Lausanne, Switzerland, where BÃ©jart founded his company, BÃ©jart Ballet Lausanne. Since then, it has been performed around the world, captivating audiences with its blend of classical and modern dance, rock and opera, humor and emotion. The ballet features some of Queen's most famous songs, such as "The Show Must Go On", "I Want to Break Free" and "Bohemian Rhapsody", as well as Mozart's symphonies and requiem. The costumes by Versace add a touch of glamour and elegance to the dancers' movements.
