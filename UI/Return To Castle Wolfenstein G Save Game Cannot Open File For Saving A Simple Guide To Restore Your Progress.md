## Solution 1: Run the Game as an Administrator
 
One of the most common reasons for the G\_SaveGame error is that the game does not have enough permissions to write files to the disk. This can happen if you are using a Windows account that does not have administrator rights, or if your antivirus or firewall software is blocking the game's access.
 
To fix this issue, you can try running the game as an administrator. This will grant the game full access to the disk and allow it to create save files. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click on the game's shortcut or executable file and select "Properties".
2. Go to the "Compatibility" tab and check the box that says "Run this program as an administrator".
3. Click "Apply" and then "OK".
4. Launch the game and try saving your progress.

If this solution works for you, you can also make it permanent by creating a shortcut with administrator privileges. To do this, follow these steps:

## Solution 2: Delete or Rename the Hunkusage.dat File
 
Another possible cause for the G\_SaveGame error is that the game's hunkusage.dat file is corrupted or outdated. This file stores information about how much memory the game uses for each level. If this file is damaged or incompatible with your system, it can prevent the game from saving your progress.
 
To fix this issue, you can try deleting or renaming the hunkusage.dat file. This will force the game to create a new one that matches your system specifications. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the game's installation folder. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Return to Castle Wolfenstein\Main.
2. Find and select the hunkusage.dat file.
3. Press "Delete" on your keyboard or right-click on it and select "Delete". Alternatively, you can rename it to something else, such as hunkusage.bak.
4. Launch the game and try saving your progress.

## Solution 3: Allow Access to Controlled Folders
 
If you are using Windows 10, you may have a feature called Controlled Folder Access enabled. This feature is part of Windows Defender Security Center and it protects your important folders from unauthorized changes by malicious software. However, it can also block legitimate applications from accessing your folders, such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein.
 
To fix this issue, you can try allowing access to controlled folders for Return to Castle Wolfenstein. This will let the game write files to your disk and create save files. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select Start > Settings.
2. Choose Update & security > Windows Defender.
3. Select Open Windows Defender Security Center.
4. Select Virus & threat protection, and then choose Virus & threat 8cf37b1e13
