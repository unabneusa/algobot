## Step 2: Configure the Component Properties
 
To configure the component properties, select the **TComPort** component on your form and go to the **Object Inspector**. Here you can set various properties of the component, such as:
 
- **BaudRate**: The speed of data transmission in bits per second. The default value is 9600.
- **DataBits**: The number of data bits in each transmitted or received byte. The default value is 8.
- **Parity**: The method of error detection for each transmitted or received byte. The default value is None.
- **StopBits**: The number of bits used to indicate the end of a byte. The default value is One.
- **DeviceName**: The name of the device that you want to communicate with. You can use the **TComPort.GetDeviceNames** method to get a list of available device names.
- **Active**: A boolean value that indicates whether the component is connected to the device or not. You can set it to True or False at design time or runtime.
- **OnRxChar**: An event that occurs when a character is received from the device. You can write your own code to handle the received data.
- **OnTxEmpty**: An event that occurs when all characters have been sent to the device. You can write your own code to send more data if needed.
- **OnError**: An event that occurs when an error occurs during communication. You can write your own code to handle the error.

## Step 3: Write Your Code for Serial Communication
 
To write your code for serial communication, you can use the following methods of the **TComPort** component:

- **TComPort.WriteStr**: A method that writes a string to the device.
- **TComPort.WriteBuf**: A method that writes a buffer of bytes to the device.
- **TComPort.ReadStr**: A method that reads a string from the device.
- **TComPort.ReadBuf**: A method that reads a buffer of bytes from the device.
- **TComPort.PurgeRxBuffer**: A method that clears the receive buffer.
- **TComPort.PurgeTxBuffer**: A method that clears the transmit buffer.
- **TComPort.FlushRxBuffer**: A method that waits until all characters have been received 8cf37b1e13
