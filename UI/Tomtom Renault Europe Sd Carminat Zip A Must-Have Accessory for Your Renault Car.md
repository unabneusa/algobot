The Carminat TomTom is a device that uses TomTom software and maps to provide you with turn-by-turn directions, traffic information, speed camera alerts and other features. It comes with a regional map pre-installed on a SD card, but you can also purchase and download maps of other regions from the TomTom website[^3^].
 
The latest version of the European map for Carminat TomTom is 10.45, which covers 45 countries and territories in Europe[^1^]. It was released in 2020 and has the most recent data on road changes, new addresses, speed limits and more. To update your map, you will need a compatible SD card (8GB or larger), a computer with an internet connection and a card reader.
