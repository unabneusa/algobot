If you have purchased some ebooks from the iBookstore and want to read them on other devices or apps, you may encounter a problem: the iBooks are protected by Apple's FairPlay DRM, which prevents you from copying or converting them to other formats. However, there is a way to remove the DRM from iBooks with a tool called Requiem 3.3.6.

Requiem is a free and open-source program that can decrypt DRM-protected files from iTunes, including music, videos, and ebooks. It works by scanning your iTunes library and replacing the encrypted files with decrypted versions. The original files are moved to the trash, so you can verify that the new files work before deleting them.
 
Requiem 3.3.6 is the latest and only version that can remove DRM from iBooks. It works with iTunes 10.5.x, Windows and Mac OS X. However, it is very outdated (2012) and may not work with newer versions of iTunes or operating systems. Therefore, you may need to downgrade your iTunes and Java versions or use a virtual machine to run Requiem.

## Steps to Remove DRM from iBooks with Requiem 3.3.6
 
1. Download Requiem 3.3.6 from [this link](https://mega.nz/file/7Z8xwKbA#Y0ZtYwQ7y8Qv0l9zFJjyLgWfX8xHmR4oqk0n5wWqf8c).
2. Install the current version of iTunes on your computer and log in to your account.
3. Authorize your computer in iTunes so it can access your purchased files.
4. Close iTunes and uninstall it along with other Apple software components (Apple Software Update, Apple Mobile Device Support, Bonjour, Apple Application Support 32-bit and 64-bit).
5. Rename or delete the folder C:/Users/~Username~/Music/iTunes (Windows) or ~/Music/iTunes (Mac).
6. Install iTunes 10.5.X and Java 7 32-bit on your computer.
7. Open iTunes and go to Edit > Preferences > Advanced. Check the boxes for "Keep iTunes Media folder organized" and "Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library". This will ensure that your files are structured in a way that Requiem can find them.
8. Add your iBooks to iTunes by dragging and dropping them into the library.
9. Quit iTunes and run Requiem.exe (Windows) or Requiem.app (Mac). A window will pop up and list any ebook files it found.
10. If it worked, Requiem will replace the DRM-protected file with a DRM-free version, and automatically throw away the old file.

Note: If you get an error message saying "Key not found. Can you open this file?", it means that either your iTunes login doesn't match the account that purchased the ebook, or you purchased the content after you authorized the computer. In either case, you need to re-authorize the computer and start over.
