# Dynomite Deluxe: A Fun and Colorful Puzzle Game
 
Dynomite Deluxe is a puzzle game developed by PopCap Games and released in 2006. The game is inspired by the classic arcade game Bust-A-Move, where you have to shoot colored balls to match three or more of the same color and make them explode. The game features four different modes: Endless, Stomped, Fossil, and Time Trial. You can also play online with other players or against the computer.
 
The game is set in the prehistoric era, where you have to help a cute dinosaur named Dyno to clear the screen of dinosaur eggs before they pile up and reach the top. You can use a slingshot to launch eggs of different colors and aim for clusters of matching eggs. When you create a group of three or more eggs of the same color, they will pop and disappear, giving you points and bonuses. You can also get special eggs that have different effects, such as bombs, fireballs, lasers, and more.
