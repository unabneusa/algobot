# How to Use the iFly 737 FSX Paint Kit
 
The iFly 737 is a popular add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator X that simulates the Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft. It features high-resolution textures, realistic flight dynamics, custom sounds, and many other features. One of the most appealing aspects of the iFly 737 is that it comes with a paint kit that allows users to create their own liveries for the aircraft.
 
A paint kit is a set of files that contains the basic textures and layers for an aircraft model. By editing these files with a graphics software such as Photoshop, users can apply different colors, logos, and details to the aircraft. The paint kit also includes instructions on how to use it and how to install the custom liveries into FSX.

In this article, we will show you how to use the iFly 737 FSX paint kit to create your own liveries. We will assume that you have already installed the iFly 737 add-on and that you have some basic knowledge of Photoshop or a similar program. If you don't have the iFly 737 add-on, you can get it from [Flight1](http://www.flight1.com/products.asp?product=iflyfsx). If you don't have Photoshop, you can use a free alternative such as [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
 
## Step 1: Download the Paint Kit
 
The first step is to download the paint kit from the [Flight1 File Library System](http://library.flight1.net/?cat=6). You can find it under the category "iFly 737NG FSX". The file name is "iFLY PANEL TWEAK.zip". It is a 342 KB file that contains two folders: "FS9" and "FSX". Depending on which version of FSX you have, you will need to use one of these folders.
 
Extract the zip file to a location of your choice. For this tutorial, we will use the "FSX" folder. Inside this folder, you will find four subfolders: "B600", "B700", "B800", and "B900". These correspond to the different variants of the Boeing 737 NG: 600, 700, 800, and 900. Each subfolder contains two files: a PSD file and a TGA file. The PSD file is the Photoshop file that contains all the layers and masks for editing. The TGA file is the final texture file that FSX uses.

## Step 2: Choose a Variant and Open the PSD File
 
The next step is to choose which variant of the iFly 737 you want to paint. For this tutorial, we will use the B800 variant, which is the most common one. Open the "B800" subfolder and double-click on the "iFLY\_738\_Paintkit.psd" file. This will open Photoshop with the paint kit loaded.
 
You will see a large image of the aircraft with several layers on the right side. Each layer represents a different part of the aircraft, such as windows, doors, wings, tail, etc. You can toggle each layer on and off by clicking on the eye icon next to it. You can also rename, duplicate, delete, or merge layers as you wish.
 
The most important layer for painting is called "FUSELAGE PAINT". This is where you will apply your colors and logos to the aircraft. You can also edit other layers such as "WING PAINT", "TAIL PAINT", or "ENGINE PAINT" if you want to change those parts as well.
 
## Step 3: Paint Your Livery
 
The fun part begins now. You can use any tools or techniques that you are familiar with in Photoshop to paint your livery. You can use brushes, gradients, filters, selections, etc. You can also use images or logos from other sources and paste them onto your livery.
 
For this tutorial, we will create a simple livery with a blue fuselage and white wings and tail. We will also add some
