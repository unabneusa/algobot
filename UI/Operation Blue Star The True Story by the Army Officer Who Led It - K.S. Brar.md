Operation Blue Star was a military operation carried out by the Indian Army in June 1984 to flush out Sikh militants who had occupied the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of Sikhism, in Amritsar. The operation was ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who faced a separatist movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a charismatic religious leader who had amassed a large number of followers and weapons inside the temple complex.
