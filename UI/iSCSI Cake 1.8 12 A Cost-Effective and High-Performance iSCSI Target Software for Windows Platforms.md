- We have configured a server to act as a Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) server, which provides Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) and gPXE services. These services allow network booting of clients using the PXE protocol.
- We have set up another server to act as a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) target, which provides access to disk storage over a network using the Internet SCSI (iSCSI) protocol.
- We have installed Windows operating system on a flat file (a raw image of a disk) and stored that file on the SCSI target server. We have used a virtual machine (VMware guest) to perform the installation.
- We have enabled iSCSI boot support in our Windows installation by installing the appropriate drivers and configuring the boot settings.
- We have launched another virtual machine (VMware guest) without any local disk storage. This machine acts as a diskless client that boots from the network.
- We have used gPXE to load the Windows boot loader from the TFTP server and then connect to the SCSI target server using iSCSI. This allows the diskless client to access the Windows flat file as if it was a local disk and boot from it.

This network boot environment has several advantages over traditional disk-based booting. For example, it reduces the need for local disk storage on the clients, which can lower the cost and power consumption of the hardware. It also simplifies the management and maintenance of the operating system images, as they can be centrally stored and updated on the SCSI target server. Furthermore, it enables faster deployment and recovery of the clients, as they can be easily reconfigured or replaced without affecting the data on the SCSI target server.

However, this network boot environment also has some challenges and limitations. For instance, it requires a reliable and fast network connection between the clients and the SCSI target server, as any network failure or congestion can affect the performance or availability of the boot process. It also depends on the compatibility and security of the PXE, TFTP, gPXE and iSCSI protocols and services, as any misconfiguration or vulnerability can cause boot errors or data breaches. Moreover, it may not support some features or applications that require direct access to the local disk or hardware of the clients, such as encryption, partitioning or virtualization.
  
To implement this network boot environment, several tools and technologies are needed. The PXE server can be set up using any operating system that supports DHCP, TFTP and gPXE services, such as Linux, Windows or FreeBSD. The SCSI target server can be set up using any operating system that supports iSCSI target software, such as Linux, Windows or Solaris. The Windows flat file can be created using any disk imaging tool that can capture and restore a raw image of a disk, such as dd, Clonezilla or Ghost. The iSCSI boot support can be enabled in Windows using any iSCSI initiator software that can install and configure the drivers and settings for network booting, such as Microsoft iSCSI Software Initiator, StarWind iSCSI Initiator or gPXE.
 
The network boot environment can be tested and verified using virtual machines that simulate the diskless clients and the servers. VMware is one of the popular virtualization platforms that can create and run virtual machines with various operating systems and hardware configurations. VMware also supports network booting using PXE and iSCSI protocols. To test the network boot environment using VMware, two virtual machines are needed: one for the PXE server and one for the diskless client. The SCSI target server can be either another virtual machine or a physical machine on the same network. The VMware virtual machines can be configured to use gPXE as the network boot firmware and to connect to the SCSI target server using iSCSI.
