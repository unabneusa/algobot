If you want to master Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition, you will need to learn some gameplay tips and tricks. Here are some of them:
 
- Use the Interactive Environment. As mentioned before, each stage has objects and elements that you can use to your advantage, such as cars, statues, rockets, and more. You can either throw them at your opponent, use them as platforms, or activate them with a button press. Some characters can use them more effectively than others, depending on their power type (gadget or power). Experiment with different stages and characters to find out what works best for you.
- Know your character's traits. Each character has a unique trait that can be activated by pressing the circle button (PS4) or the B button (Xbox One). These traits can give you various benefits, such as increased damage, speed, armor, health regeneration, or special abilities. For example, Batman can summon three mechanical bats that can attack his opponent or act as a shield, while Superman can temporarily boost his strength and durability. Learn when and how to use your character's trait to gain an edge in battle.
- Master the clash system. The clash system is a mechanic that allows you to wager your super meter against your opponent's when you are in your second health bar. You can initiate a clash by pressing forward and the meter burn button (R2 or RT) when you are being hit by a combo. You and your opponent will then have to choose how much of your super meter you want to bet (up to four bars). The winner of the clash will either deal damage or regain health, depending on who initiated it. The clash system can be a game-changer if used wisely, so make sure you know when to use it and how much to bet.
- Use your super moves. Super moves are powerful attacks that can deal massive damage to your opponent. You can perform them by pressing both triggers (L2 and R2 or LT and RT) when you have a full super meter (four bars). Each character has a different super move that showcases their abilities and personality. For example, The Flash can run around the world and punch his opponent with the force of a meteor, while Aquaman can summon a giant shark to bite his opponent. Super moves are not only flashy and satisfying, but also effective and easy to execute.
- Practice, practice, practice. The best way to improve your skills in Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition is to practice regularly. You can use the Training Mode to learn the basics of the game, such as movement, attacks, combos, blocks, counters, and more. You can also use the S.T.A.R. Labs Mode to complete various challenges that test your abilities and knowledge of the game. You can also play online against other players or offline against the AI to hone your skills and strategies.

With these tips, you will be able to enjoy Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition even more and become a better fighter. Have fun!
