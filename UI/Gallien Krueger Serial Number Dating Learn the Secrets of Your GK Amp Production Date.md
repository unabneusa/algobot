## Check the Location of the Serial Number
 
The location of the serial number on your Gallien Krueger bass amp can give you a clue about its age. According to a forum post by Robert Gallien himself[^1^], the serial number is usually located on the rear panel, bottom left side, below the power cord socket, just to the left of the heat sinks. However, some older models may have a sticker with the production date on it, such as 3-87 for March 1987[^1^]. If you can't find the serial number or the sticker, you may have to open up the amp and look inside for any markings or labels.
 
## Use a Simple Formula to Estimate the Year
 
Once you have found the serial number on your Gallien Krueger bass amp, you can use a simple formula to estimate the year it was made. According to Robert Gallien[^1^], the serial number is composed of six digits, and the first two digits indicate the year. For example, if your serial number is 119160, then it was made in 1993 (11 + 1982 = 1993). However, this formula only works for amps made after 1982. For amps made before 1982, you may have to contact Gallien Krueger directly or consult other sources for more information.
 
## Compare Your Amp with Other Models and Features
 
Another way to date your Gallien Krueger bass amp by serial number is by comparing it with other models and features that were available at that time. For example, if you have a GMT 300B head, you can narrow down its age to the early 1970s, around 1973 or 1974, because these were apparently made in Bob Gallien's garage and were among his first products[^1^]. You can also look at the design, color, knobs, switches, logos, and other details of your amp and see how they match with different eras of Gallien Krueger's history. You can find some images and videos of various Gallien Krueger products on their website[^2^] or on YouTube[^1^].
