## Benefits of Reciting the Devi Mahatmyam
 
Reciting the Devi Mahatmyam is not only a way of honoring and worshipping the Goddess, but also a way of attaining her grace and blessings. The Devi Mahatmyam is said to have the power to fulfill all kinds of desires, whether material or spiritual, and to remove all kinds of obstacles, whether internal or external. The Devi Mahatmyam also confers protection, healing, happiness, prosperity and success to those who recite it with faith and devotion.
 
According to various scriptures and traditions, reciting the Devi Mahatmyam has different benefits depending on the number of times it is recited. For example, reciting it three times can help to get rid of effects of black magic, five times can help to get rid of difficulties caused by planets, seven times can help to get rid of great fear, nine times can achieve peace, eleven times can win royal favors, twelve times can overpower foes, twenty-five times can release from prison, thirty times can cure from cancer, a hundred times can relieve from great dishonor, and a thousand times can mitigate loss of wealth and ensure steady prosperity[^1^] [^2^].
 
However, the ultimate benefit of reciting the Devi Mahatmyam is to awaken the Divine Mother consciousness within oneself and to activate the shakti or energy in one's chakras or energy centers. By reciting the Devi Mahatmyam, one can connect with the Mother as the supreme reality and experience her love, wisdom and power in one's life. The Devi Mahatmyam is a means of transforming oneself from a limited human being to a divine being by the grace of the Goddess.
